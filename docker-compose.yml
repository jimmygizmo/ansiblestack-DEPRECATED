# For production deployment on AWS:

#    SETUP: To use a full repository URL image name, customize a URL like the one here:
#    image: <YOUR-AWS-USER-ID-NUMBER>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/<YOUR-AWS-REPO-NAME>:ansiblestack-nucleus-api
#
# CONSIDER FOR ALL CONTAINERS:
#    restart: unless-stopped

# NUCLEUS API NOTES:
# Cannot connect to Flask from outside the container unless you tell Flask to listen on 0.0.0.0. This issue has been
# seen before. The default (which does not work for me, at least on macOS, is localhost or 127.0.0.1. Neither work
# on macOS. I would have to test to see if this is also the case on Linux. I suspect the issue is the same when
# the host OS of the docker engine is Linux. It could just be a basic networking issue. 127.0.0.1/localhost are the
# loopback address, not intended for external access. Running locally a browser probably COULD access localhost,
# actually I know it can. It is because this is running in a container and hence it is a separate logical host.
