This script is kept here for documentation purposes.
This is part of the WY base image. This script is the entrypoint of the Docker image,
called at the end of our Dockerfile according WY base image usage instructions.

First it reads the 3 ENV vars this image uses, which perhaps only get used here.

It installs roles and then runs the defined playbook.
