The sub-directories of a role:

defaults –  Includes default values for role variables. Use sensible/safe values here. Many/most may be overridden.

files  – Any kind of file used by the role's actions. Assets/resources, in a sense but can be anything.

handlers – The role's tasks trigger the handlers.

meta – Metadata information for the role: dependencies, author, platforms, license, ...

tasks – A sequence of tasks to be executed by this role. Like a playbook's task sequence.

templates – Templates used by the role's tasks, in the Jinja2 format.

tests – Config files for testing the role.

vars – Variables used by the role. These have a high precedence and will override most other equivalent values.
